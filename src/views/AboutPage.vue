          <p>I, Darleen, respectfully acknowledge the Wurundjeri people as the Traditional Custodians of the land on which I live, work, and study, the lands of the Eastern Kulin Nation.</p>
          <p>I pay my respects to the Woiwurrung language group, and to their Elders past, present, and emerging, as well as Elders of other communities.</p>
          <p>I am grateful for their protection of this beautiful land and recognize the deep, enduring connection Indigenous Australians have with their land and waters.</p>
          <p>As an RMIT fashion student, I am committed to learning about and respecting their culture, and to caring for this land, its resources, and environment.</p>

          <p>Hi! Iâ€™m Darleen from Guizhou, China. My life experiences are the main inspiration for my creations, and I love capturing small details in my work.</p>
          <p>Growing up, I learned about Chinese liquor-making from my dad, which sparked my interest in fermentation, especially the sorghum fermentation process used in liquor production.</p>
          <p>My project "Magic Mosaic" blends influence from both natural and urban environments.</p>
          <p>One day, when I noticed the wrinkles on skin, I had a sudden realization about the microorganisms living on it, which inspired me further.</p>
          <p>Oh, and I have a super cute cat!</p>
